    "## Accessing the colormaps\n",
    "\n",
    "After importing `contrib_colormaps` as `cc`, all the colormaps will be available for use in different forms. It's a bit difficult to describe, but the idea is that this library should have at least one such form convenient for any particular application.  There are two different basic versions for each colormap, each of which is fundamentally a list of colors: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A Bokeh-style palette, i.e., a Python list of RGB colors as hex strings, like ``['#000000', ..., '#ffffff']``\n",
    "2. If matplotlib is installed and importable, a Matplotlib ``LinearSegmentedColormap`` using normalized magnitudes, like ``LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list(\"fire\",[ [0.0,0.0,0.0], ..., [1.0,1.0,1.0] ], 256)``\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bokeh-compatible palettes are provided as attributes in the ``contrib_colormaps`` namespace, with long names prefixed with ``b_``.  E.g. ``rainforest`` can be accessed as ``cc.b_sample``.  These names should tab complete once ``cc`` has been imported.  Because Bokeh palettes are just Python lists, you can always reverse them using normal Python syntax, e.g. ``list(reversed(cc.b_sample))``, or use subsets of them with slice notation, e.g. ``cc.b_sample[25:]``.  If you want to access the palettes by string name, they are also collected into a dictionary named ``palette``, so you can use ``cc.palette[\"sample\"]`` or ``cc.palette.sample``; whichever is more convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Matplotlib colormaps are also provided as tab-completable attributes, but consistently with a prefix ``m_``, e.g. ``cc.m_sample``.  Already reversed versions are also available, as ``cc.m_sample_r``.  The same colormaps are also registered with matplotlib's string-based dictionary with the prefix ``cc_``, making them available by name within various matplotlib functions (e.g. ``cc_sample``, ``cc_sample_r``).  Finally, if you want to access the colormaps by string name without using Matplotlib's registry, they are also stored in the ``cc.cm`` dictionary, e.g. ``cc.cm[\"sample\"]`` or ``cc.cm[\"sample_r\"]``."
